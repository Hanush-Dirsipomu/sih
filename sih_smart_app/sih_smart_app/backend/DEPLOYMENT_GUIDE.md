## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd sih_smart_app/sih_smart_app/backend

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install additional packages
pip install PyJWT google-generativeai

# Set environment variables (optional)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key"

# Run development server
python app.py
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to Flutter app
cd sih_smart_app/sih_smart_app/frontend/mobile_app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on device/emulator
flutter run

# For specific device
flutter devices
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

## 🔐 Authentication System

### JWT Token Flow
1. **Login**: POST `/api/login` with credentials
2. **Response**: Receive JWT token with user info
3. **Authorization**: Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in headers
4. **Admin Routes**: All `/api/admin/*` routes require admin JWT token

### Example API Usage
```bash
# 1. Login as admin
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "college_id": "admin",
    "password": "password",
    "role": "admin"
  }'

# 2. Use returned token for admin operations
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/dashboard/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>"
```

## 🏫 Multi-Institutional Usage

### Institution Registration
Any college can register via:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/admin/institutions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "New College Name",
    "admin_name": "Admin Full Name",
    "admin_email": "admin@college.edu",
    "admin_password": "secure_password",
    "address": "College Address",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "email": "contact@college.edu"
  }'
```

### Admin Workflow
1. **Register Institution** → Get unique registration code
2. **Login as Admin** → Access institution dashboard
3. **Setup Academic Structure**:
   - Create Branches (e.g., Computer Science, Mechanical)
   - Add Semesters to each branch
   - Define Subjects for each semester
4. **User Management**:
   - Add Teachers with departments
   - Add Students with college IDs
5. **Timetable Creation**:
   - Assign teachers to subjects
   - Create class schedules with time/room
6. **Student Enrollment**:
   - Enroll students in appropriate semesters
